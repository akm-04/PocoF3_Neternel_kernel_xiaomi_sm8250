============
For devs that want to fork this repo, you must clone the KernelSU repo to avoid compilation errors.
curl -LSs "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiann/KernelSU/main/kernel/setup.sh" | bash -s v0.9.5
if you want to compile with a specific KernelSU version, after clonning kernelSU,
cd KernelSU
git fetch --tags
# Make note of which version of kernelSU you want to compile with.
git tag 
# Checkout correct version | Example |
git checkout v0.9.5

for compiling Nethunter Modules, on the root directory of kernel, clone:

git clone https://github.com/akm-04/NetErnels-Modules.git NetErnel_modules

To compile:
edit build.sh or aosp_build.sh, set correct parameters ie: which defconfig to use
Then run ./build.sh to start compiling or run ./aosp_build.sh to compile using aosp clang (make sure clang path is specified according to your needs)

| build.sh uses clang and binutils that installed on your system globally so make sure they are installed before compiling

apt-get install clang binutils

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
